# mksite.py

Makes a basic as hell blog. No pagination, nothing fancy, just markdown, two required template names ('post.html' and 'index.html') and some posts. Might not work too great, then again I didn't mean for this to be all to great anyway.

See `python mksite --help` for the most basic help screen in the world.
